# ZED IMAGE BUILDER #
# README            #

# OVERVIEW #
ZED Image Builder is a tool for packing ZED content files into one file for
optimal access and to reduce the overall storage space occupied.  Files can
be compressed within the image on a per file basis.  Multiple pieces of content
referencing one file will not result in multiple copies of that referenced
file.  The original files added to the image building process will not be
modified.  References to other files from within content will be resolved
inside the processed file resulting from the content hashing process.

A directed acyclic graph will be used to maintain the heirarchy of files and
allow for files which are dependencies to be hashed without the hash becoming
useless once the tree is traversed.

                 V
               [Hash] <- Material A's references to the shader and textures is
                         resolved to their hashed equivalents

                 V
              <Model A>
                 |
                 V
               [Hash] <- Model A's references to the material is used, then
                         the model file is hashed
