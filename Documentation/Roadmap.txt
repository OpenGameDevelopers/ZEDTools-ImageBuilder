# ZED IMAGE BUILDER #
# ROADMAP           #

# INTRODUCTION #
There are an abundance of features to implement for the Image Builder tool,
unfortunately it is a dependency problem with regards to rendering content for
previewing here, as the engine is not yet finished.  As such, development for
both the tool and engine will need to catch up to each other.

For the time being, the interface will be worked on, the project file layout,
patching the file name paths to hashed numbers, and the file browser interface.
